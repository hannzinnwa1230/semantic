# Validation of semantic-based wireless watermarking secure communication technique

Abstract: This paper proposes a semantic based wireless watermarking secure communication technique, by analyzing the shortcomings of traditional watermarking and using genetic algorithms to optimize the generation of digital watermarked images, incorporating semantic content information, thus enhancing the security of digital watermarking communication. The research also covers the use of basic and multi-layer autoencoders to generate digital watermarks, implements a digital watermarking algorithm based on DCT-DWT-SVD, and optimizes it to achieve the best balance between robustness and transparency. In addition, the paper also designs the corresponding transmitter and receiver for the SDR platform according to the 802.11a protocol, and comprehensively demonstrates the whole communication process.
